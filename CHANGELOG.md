## Bottery Nightly

_Changes to be released_

#### Enhancements

- Handler instances returns the selected view ([#161](https://github.com/rougeth/bottery/issues/161))
- Move Telegram and Messenger modules to outside `platform` module. Also rename `platform` module to `platforms` (due to Python builtin `platform` module) ([#161](https://github.com/rougeth/bottery/issues/165))
- Create option to change msg handlers module ([#172](https://github.com/rougeth/bottery/issues/172))
- Remove unused `settings_module` option from Bottery ([#173](https://github.com/rougeth/bottery/issues/173))
- Added Python 3.7 to `tox.ini` ([#169](https://github.com/rougeth/bottery/issues/169))

#### Bug fixes

- Stop responding with `null` when a view doesn't return anything ([#154](https://github.com/rougeth/bottery/issues/154))
- Stop the loop when bot is unable to retrieve updates from Telegram ([#179](https://github.com/rougeth/bottery/issues/179))
